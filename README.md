# OS
The OS in this version is not ready for use on real hardware. It probably won't work. It can also break your machine.<br />
For your and your hardware safety use it only as VM.<br />
To compile the source code you need a gcc/g++ cross compiler for instructions how to build the cross compiler visit this [page](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler).

###Changelog:
* Screen printing is working.
* Keyboard input is working.
* Commands are working.
