# OS
The OS in this version is not ready for use on real hardware. It probably won't work. It can also break your machine.
For your and your hardware safety use it only as VM. To compile the source code you need a gcc/g++ cross compiler for instructions how to build the cross compiler visit this [page](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)

###Changelog:
* Screen printing is working.
* Keyboard input is working.
* Commands aren't working.
